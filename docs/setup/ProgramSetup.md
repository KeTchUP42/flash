 ## Program setup:

 **To setup project you must have to do some steps:**
 1. Unzip the appropriate version of the library to `./lib/` directory.
 2. You need to install the cmake and gcc compiler if you don't have them installed.
 3. Run "cmake --build cmake-build-release --target Flash -- -j 1".
 4. Move `data` and `config` to directory with target binary file. An archive with application data will be in release.
