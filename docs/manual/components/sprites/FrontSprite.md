 ## Front sprite

 The image that is placed in front of the main depicted objects.

 Configuration block example:

    [FrontSprite]
    X = 100
    Y = 100
    WIDTH = 100
    HEIGHT = 100
    ANGLE = 0
    TEXTURE = sprite.jpg

 ### Explanation:

 * `X`, `Y`, `WIDTH`, `HEIGHT` and `ANGLE` - options allow you to specify the position and orientation of sprite's physical area on the screen.
 * `TEXTURE` - path to image file.
