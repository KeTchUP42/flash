 ## What should I know about engine scenes?

 The ability to write configuration files scene is a feature of this small engine. Scenes serve for convenient description and editing of game levels
 from the list of ready-made and tested components. Also, when describing a scene before the first configuration block of an object, 
 you can prescribe directives that will affect the display globally. You can find a description of all directives - [here](Directives.md).  
 If you are not familiar with the list of components, it is recommended to read their description in advance in the manual.  

*The simple example of a level will be in files attached to release.*
