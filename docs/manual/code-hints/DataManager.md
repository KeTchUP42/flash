 ### DataManager:

 Data manager uses as a **global** unique object. It allows you to upload data without being tied to their specific location.  
 If you want to see its code you can find it [here](../../../engine/main/data/manager/DataManager.h).   

 ### Notes:

 * If you want to keep it in your class you need to keep it like a **general** pointer, without clean up.
