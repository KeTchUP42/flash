 ### Project setup:
 
 **To setup project you must have to do some simple steps:**
 1. Unzip the appropriate version of the library to './lib/' directory.
 2. Run "cmake --build cmake-build-release --target Flash -- -j 1".
 3. Move `data` and `config` to directory with target binary file. An archive with application data will be in release.
