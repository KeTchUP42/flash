 # Project setup:
 
 **To setup project you must have to do some simple steps:**
 1. Unzip the appropriate version of the library to './lib/' directory.
 2. Run "cmake --build cmake-build-release --target Flash("Or other name!") -- -j 1" command.
 3. Then you can need to move data and config directories to directory with target binary file.
